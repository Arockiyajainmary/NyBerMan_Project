# NyBerMan_Internship_Project
NGS data analysis

This project was accomplished for the assessment in a 15-day internship conducted by NyberMan Bioinformatics, Europe.

We were provided with intensive training on NGS/WGS on the human genome for variant analysis. Then, we were assigned the task to identify and characterize the genetic variants, SNPs, indels and structural variants of WGS of the human genome (chromosome15) for tongue cancer patient samples using gatk pipeline.

The genomic data analysis was done by Md Zainul Ali (https://www.linkedin.com/in/mdzainulali) and the interpretation of the results was done by Arockiyajainmary (www.linkedin.com/in/arockiyajainmary-m-2b3743166).

BioProject- PRJEB62494
Reference human genome: Hg38/chromosome 15
Sequence data: ERR11468775, ERR11468776 and ERR11468777 SRA accessions.

Description-
Whole Genome Sequencing of Tongue cancer samples and cell line 
Instrument: Illumina HiSeq 1500; WGS; Paired; Genomic
Tongue cancer patient - a habit of tobacco chewing and alcohol consumption - Somatic
WGS library was prepared with Illumina-compatible NEXTFlex Rapid DNA Sequencing Bundle. Purified fragments were end-repaired, adenylated and ligated to Illumina multiplex barcode adaptors as per NEXTFlex Rapid DNA sequencing bundle kit protocol.
